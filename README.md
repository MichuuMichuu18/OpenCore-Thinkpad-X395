# OpenCore-ThinkPad-X395

Welcome! Here I've uploaded my EFI image for booting macOS Tahoe on my ThinkPad using OpenCore. It needs to be cleaned up a bit. So far the installer is working (without 3D acceleration). However, after the installation process, the system suddenly restarts a few seconds upon entering graphical mode. I haven't had the patience for testing it more with NootedRed disabled, as without it no crashes or restarts happen. Waiting for further NootedRed development (as of 2025-10-30).

Hardware: AMD Ryzen 5 PRO 3500U w/ AMD Radeon Vega 8
